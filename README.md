# car_detection_and_tracking

We would like to measure how many vehicles cross a certain line and their movement direction while
crossing it.
For example, in the frame below, we would like to know how many vehicles crossed the blue line while
moving in the red arrow direction and how many crossed while moving in the green arrow direction.
